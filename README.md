These are project I created for my work. I have edited the files for confidential information. Some variables and field names have been changed to ensure confedentiality.

In preperation for a trade show, I was tasked with creating customer facing Excel workbooks.
Each workbook was to be the same and the customer would type in their code and the workbook would output their data.
In 2 months I learned VBA. I had never written a line of VBA code previously.
I created several VBA modules that allowed for this functionality.
The Save Copies Excel module is one of my favorites. I was tasked to create over 100 copies of the workbooks to send to each customer. Instead of going through the laborious and tedious task of doing them manually, I wrote this module to automate them.
This module saved me time and without it the process of making copies of the workbooks would not have been possible.
I'm sure the code could be optimized to run faster and more efficiently, but for my puposes it worked well.
